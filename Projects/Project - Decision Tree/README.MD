# Gender, Age, Salary - Purchase Prediction Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting the likelihood of an individual making a purchase based on gender, age, and salary. The project follows the Machine Learning Life Cycle, encompassing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training and validation, inference, and presentation.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Machine Learning Life Cycle:**
   - Ensure you follow the standard machine learning life cycle steps: problem definition, data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, validation, and inference.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct thorough EDA on the dataset, examining the relationships between variables.
   - Utilize Seaborn for creating visualizations to better understand the data.
   - Provide insights and interpretations for each analysis.

3. **Model Training and Validation:**
   - Train and validate machine learning models for purchase prediction.
   - Save the models and include code for training and validation.

4. **Inference:**
   - Provide code for making predictions on new data using the trained models.
   - Ensure proper print statements and rounding of numbers for clarity.

5. **HTML Submission:**
   - Submit the HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook used for this project.


6. **Code Saving:**
   - Save the code in a Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb) with the name "iphone_purchase_prj_8".

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvianshDarekar/gender-age-salary-purchase-prediction.git
cd gender-age-salary-purchase-prediction
```

2. Explore the notebooks, graphs, and datasets for a detailed understanding of the project.

3. Run the provided code and follow the documentation for each step.

4. Refer to the presentations for a summary of the project's objectives, solutions, and business impact.
